    \class Bridge

    \inmodule QtWebChannel
    \brief Exposes Objects to remote HTML clients.
    \since 5.4

    The Bridge fills the gap between C++ applications and HTML/JavaScript
    applications. By publishing a Object derived object to a Bridge and
    using the \l{Qt WebChannel JavaScript API}{Bridge.js} on the HTML side, one can transparently access
    properties and public slots and methods of the Object. No manual message
    passing and serialization of data is required, property updates and signal emission
    on the C++ side get automatically transmitted to the potentially remotely running HTML clients.
    On the client side, a JavaScript object will be created for any published C++ Object. It mirrors the
    C++ object's API and thus is intuitively useable.

    The C++ Bridge API makes it possible to talk to any HTML client, which could run on a local
    or even remote machine. The only limitation is that the HTML client supports the JavaScript
    features used by \c{Bridge.js}. As such, one can interact
    with basically any modern HTML browser or standalone JavaScript runtime, such as node.js.

    There also exists a declarative \l{Qt WebChannel QML Types}{WebChannel API}.
